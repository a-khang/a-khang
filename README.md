Hi, I'm Khang — a student with a background in both commerce and technology, working toward a career in cybersecurity. I'm especially interested in how startups and growing businesses tackle challenges around security, strategy, and ethics. I’ve earned my CompTIA Security+ certification and am actively building my skills in information security and IT audit. I'm eager to gain hands-on experience, keep learning, and contribute to creating secure, reliable systems.

## Objectives
Through my exploration of information systems and cybersecurity, I’ve come to believe that strategically aligned security practices are essential for organizations embracing digital innovation — especially as they face an increasingly complex threat landscape.

This portfolio serves as a space to share my projects, perspectives, and certifications as I continue developing my skills and career in cybersecurity. Here, you can follow my journey as I practice Blue Team and GRC skills and apply them to a fictional startup scenario — one that closely mirrors a real-world project in which I’m involved. The scenario has been abstracted and obfuscated to protect the internal security posture of the organization while still reflecting realistic challenges.
