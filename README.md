_A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man._

~ A Hero's Journey, Joseph Campbell

Hi, I'm Khang — a student with a background in both commerce and technology, working toward a career in cybersecurity. 

My interest in cyber must have sparked when I was about nine and tried to download "Free Minecraft" onto my dad's Windows 7 laptop. This was later ignited towards the end of high school after graduating the Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity Academy. Cybersecurity is a flame I am still kindling, and I'm especially interested in how startups and growing businesses tackle challenges around balancing security and progress. I’ve earned my CompTIA Security+ certification and am actively building my skills in information security and IT audit. I'm eager to gain hands-on experience, keep learning, and contribute to creating secure, reliable systems.

## Objectives and Approach
This portfolio serves as a space to share my learnings, projects, and perspectives as I continue developing my skills and career in cybersecurity. Today, depth is valued over breadth of knowledge areas. To build effective T-shaped skills to guide me to GRC in the long term, I have a plan:

1. Build breadth across various cybersecurity domains.
2. Create depth by communicating cybersecurity and bridging it to the business context.
