Hi, I'm Khang — a student with a background in both commerce and technology, working toward a career in cybersecurity. I'm especially interested in how startups and growing businesses tackle challenges around security, strategy, and ethics. I’ve earned my CompTIA Security+ certification and am actively building my skills in information security and IT audit. I'm eager to gain hands-on experience, keep learning, and contribute to creating secure, reliable systems.

## Objectives
Through my exploration of information systems and cybersecurity, I’ve come to believe that strategically aligned security practices are essential for organizations embracing digital innovation, especially as they face an increasingly complex threat landscape.

This portfolio serves as a space to share my projects, perspectives, and certifications as I continue developing my skills and career in cybersecurity. Here, you can follow my journey as I practice Blue Team and GRC skills and apply them to a fictional startup scenario — one that closely mirrors a real-world project in which I’m involved. The scenario has been abstracted and obfuscated to protect the internal security posture of the organization while still reflecting realistic challenges.
